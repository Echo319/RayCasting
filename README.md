#RayCasting

##Structure

Main should create two views
	overhead 
	First person
	
###Overhead

should show something like a square window with some lines acting as a sorta maze like thing
first demo should only be the one line i guess

Then a particle that shoots out rays
Rays that intersect with a barrier should be displayed


###FirstPerson

This view should be limited to a small section, something like 60-90 degrees. 
Each ray that is cast will correspond to a slice of the screen
the distance the ray is away needs to be calculated and the item on screen needs to be displayed.
